1. What is the difference between the approach of performance testing with JMeter and profiling with IntelliJ Profiler in the context of optimizing application performance?
   The difference is for JMeter, it simulates many users that fetch the application. On the other hand, for Intellij Profiler counts the time it takes to do the application
2. How does the profiling process help you in identifying and understanding the weak points in your application?
   It helps me to know which method takes time the most so that I can know my weakness. Then, I can refactor it to run faster
3. Do you think IntelliJ Profiler is effective in assisting you to analyze and identify bottlenecks in your application code?
   It is pretty effective because it provides detailed information about the performance.
4. What are the main challenges you face when conducting performance testing and profiling, and how do you overcome these challenges?
   For me is to find which method that run the slowest so that I can refactor it.
5. What are the main benefits you gain from using IntelliJ Profiler for profiling your application code?
   The main benefits I can gain from using IntelliJ Profiler is that I can see many detailed information about the running application in a detailed way.
6. How do you handle situations where the results from profiling with IntelliJ Profiler are not entirely consistent with findings from performance testing using JMeter?
   I would analyze both the jmeter and intellij profiler to find the differences. Then, if there are some similarities regarding the throughput time, I would probably fix that one first. Then, I would analyze further the inconsistencies to find the weakness.
7. What strategies do you implement in optimizing application code after analyzing results from performance testing and profiling? How do you ensure the changes you make do not affect the application's functionality?
   For most of the time, I would probably use my past knowledge in DSA class. If the code is not fast enough, I may use some sort or eliminate the for loop such that it runs faster. This should not affect the application's functionality
